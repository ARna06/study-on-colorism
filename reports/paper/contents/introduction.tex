    \textit{What types of social biases can we analyze and detect through the lens of a visual medium of popular entertainment?} In this article, we focus on Bollywood, aka the Mumbai film industry, and analyze a curated corpus of films (top 5 grossing each year) for the last 10 years. While Bollywood is an entertainment industry worth billions and has a target audience of 1.2 billion
    people, little or no work exists that analyzed a wide range of social biases and signals that can be uncovered from this rich data. In this work, we contrast our findings for a specific subset of research questions, we dig deeper and look into world movies.

    \textit{Our primary focus is skin tone bias}. We are, however, interested in a broader research question: In a developing nation, what kind of social insights can be gleanedfrom popular entertainment? Is it possible to understand subtle skin tone bias? 

    \textit{Our second focus in this work is broader representation questions}. In our mixed method analyses, we identify that (1) some of role biases observed in Bollywood is very much present in its resultant gender bias; (2) a positive trend is witnessed in observing reduced biases with progress of time and; and (3) a similar trend is observed in religious and geographic representation, with a
    considerable scope for improved diversity and inclusion.
